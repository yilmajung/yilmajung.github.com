### Abstract
This study, focusing on two Reddit subcommunities of r/ToastMe and r/RoastMe, aims to (1) characterize and understand users (named Jekyll and Hyde) who simultaneously participate in two subreddits with opposing tones and purposes, (2) build predictive models detecting those Jekyll and Hyde users to assess how unique and idiosyncratic their characteristics are, and (3) investigate their motivations of participation and potential interaction between the two contrasting activities through a survey and one-on-one interviews. Our results reveal that the Jekyll and Hyde users are generally more active and popular than ordinary users. Also, they use assimilated language customized to each community’s tone. Combining these findings with their motivations unveiled through the survey and interviews, we conclude that the Jekyll and Hyde users are digitally culture-savvy, who know how to utilize online community benefits and enjoy each community’s culture by assimilating themselves into the community and observing its rules. Moreover, the users’ duality observed in this process underscores the dynamic and multifaceted nature of online personas. These findings highlight the need for a nuanced approach to understanding online behaviors and provide insights for designing healthier online environments, emphasizing the importance of clear community norms and the potential interplay of users’ activities across different communities.
